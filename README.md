# trolleyproblems
A generator for trolley problems.

Trolley problems are ethical thought experiments about making life-or-death decisions where you may choose to redirect a runaway trolley. Lots of variations exist exploring questions of action versus inaction, culpability, etc. but not everyone agrees that this kind of artificial setup is particularly applicable or enlightening.

Proximately, McSweeneys posted some [joke trolley problems](http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/lesser-known-trolley-problem-variations) that inspired me to create this generator.

Pull requests for more entities threatened by the Trolley of Doom and Ethics are very welcome!
